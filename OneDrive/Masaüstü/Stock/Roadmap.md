Project Start and Setup Roadmap

Preliminary Setup and Installation of Necessary Tools

Requirement Analysis:
Thoroughly review the PRD to identify the project's technical requirements (e.g., .NET Core, PostgreSQL, Angular 19.1.2, PrimeNG).
Development Tools and Environment Setup:
.NET Core SDK: Install the .NET Core environment for backend development.
PostgreSQL: Set up the PostgreSQL database server on your local machine or a server and perform the basic configurations.
Node.js & npm: Install Node.js and npm for creating the Angular project and managing packages.
Angular CLI: Install the Angular CLI tool to start an Angular 17+ project.
IDE/Editor: Prepare your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio or VS Code.
Design and Planning

Determining the System Architecture:
Plan how the backend, database, and frontend will integrate.
Database and Data Model Design:
Design the tables, relationships, and data structures to be used in PostgreSQL.
UI/UX Design:
Begin designing the user interface (wireframes, mockups) and planning dynamic navigation.
Create a plan for role-based access and page permissions.
Backend Development (.NET Core)

Project Skeleton Setup:
Initialize the .NET Core project and apply basic configurations (e.g., configuring appsettings.json).
Module Development:
User Management: Develop modules for account creation, role assignment, and permissions.
Encryption: Integrate industry-standard encryption algorithms.
Logging: Set up an audit log system to track user activities.
Database Integration:
Establish the connection with PostgreSQL, create the data access layer, and implement necessary CRUD operations.
Frontend Development (Angular & PrimeNG)

Initializing the Angular Project:
Use the Angular CLI to create a new project and add the essential dependencies.
PrimeNG Integration:
Include the PrimeNG library for UI components and configure the styling.
Dynamic Navigation and Access Controls:
Develop a structure that determines which pages a user can access based on their role.
Integrate backend APIs to implement dynamic data flow.
Integration, Testing, and Security Configurations

API Integration:
Integrate the backend APIs with the frontend and test the data exchange.
Testing Process:
Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and security tests to ensure smooth system functionality.
Verify compatibility with desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Security Checks:
Review role-based access, encryption, and logging mechanisms.
Ensure that the application is accessible only via desktop browsers.
Final Setup and Deployment

Deployment to a Local Server:
Deploy the application, which has been tested in the development environment, to a server within the local network.
Configuration and Final Adjustments:
Complete server configurations, firewall settings, and other infrastructure requirements.
Final Testing and Validation:
Perform a final round of tests on the integration of all components (backend, frontend, database).
Validate user access and security settings one last time.

# RxJS Best Practices (Angular 19)

This document provides guidelines for effectively using RxJS observables and operators within this Angular 19 project.

- Use `AsyncPipe` in templates to auto-subscribe and avoid memory leaks
- Manage subscriptions properly in components
- Use `takeUntilDestroyed` operator for automatic unsubscription
- Implement proper error handling with `catchError`
- Use `shareReplay` for multicasting Observables
- Implement retry logic with `retryWhen`
- Use proper cache management with `share` and `publishReplay`

- Use nested selectors to improve readability and maintainability
- Implement variables for consistent theming across the application
- Use mixins for reusable style patterns
- Implement proper naming conventions (e.g., BEM) for better CSS organization
- Use partials to modularize styles and improve reusability
- Avoid deep nesting to prevent overly specific selectors
- Use the `@extend` directive judiciously to reduce CSS bloat
